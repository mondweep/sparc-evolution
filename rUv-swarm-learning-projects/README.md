## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project folder contains:
- Main application file (`.js`)
- Comprehensive README with detailed documentation
- Generated outputs and reports
- `package.json` for dependencies

To run any project:
```bash
cd projects/[project-folder]
node [main-file].js
```

## 📚 Learning Path

Follow the projects in order (01-07) for the best learning experience. Each builds on concepts from the previous ones, progressing from basic coordination to enterprise-grade systems.

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- **Fundamental Concepts**: Swarm topologies, agent coordination, hooks system
- **Advanced Patterns**: Memory persistence, neural evolution, parallel execution
- **Real-World Skills**: API development, microservices, production deployment
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Security, testing, monitoring, scalability

This learning journey demonstrates the revolutionary potential of multi-agent coordination for modern software development.
