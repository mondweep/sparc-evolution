```

## How It Works

### 1. Neural Swarm Initialization
```javascript
// Ring topology enables continuous learning flow

InsightGenerator: Knowledge synthesis patterns
LearningCoordinator: Coordination patterns
```

### 3. Training Scenarios

- **Performance Optimization Learning**: Optimize strategies through trial and error
- **Adaptive Strategy Development**: Develop context-aware adaptations
- **Cross-Agent Knowledge Transfer**: Share learnings between agents
- **Insight Generation and Synthesis**: Create actionable insights

### 4. Pattern Evolution and Adaptation
