# Project 1 Learning Summary: Hello Swarm

## What We've Learned

### 1. ruv-swarm Architecture
- **Coordination Layer**: ruv-swarm acts as a project manager
- **Execution Layer**: Claude Code performs actual implementation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Thinking/planning vs doing

### 2. Core Commands
```bash
# Initialize a swarm
npx ruv-swarm init --topology <type> --agents <number>

# Check status
npx ruv-swarm status

# Use hooks for coordination
npx ruv-swarm hook <hook-name> --description "task"

# Start MCP server (for Claude Code integration)
npx ruv-swarm mcp start
```

### 3. Swarm Topologies
- **Mesh**: All agents interconnected (collaborative tasks)
- **Hierarchical**: Tree structure (structured workflows)
- **Star**: Central coordinator (centralized control)
- **Ring**: Circular pattern (pipeline processing)

### 4. Hooks System
Hooks enable automated coordination:
- `pre-task`: Planning before execution
- `post-edit`: Notification after changes
- `notification`: Share updates between agents
- Session management: Save/restore state

### 5. MCP Integration
To use with Claude Code:
1. Add MCP server: `claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start`
2. Access tools with `mcp__ruv-swarm__` prefix
3. Tools include: swarm_init, agent_spawn, task_orchestrate, memory_usage

## Real-World Analogy

Think of building a house:
- **ruv-swarm**: The architect and project manager
  - Designs the blueprint
  - Coordinates workers
  - Tracks progress
  - Manages resources
  
- **Claude Code**: The construction workers
  - Actually build walls
  - Install plumbing
  - Paint rooms
  - Do physical work

## Key Takeaways

1. **Agents are not coders**: They're cognitive patterns that help organize thinking
2. **Coordination ≠ Execution**: ruv-swarm plans, Claude Code implements
3. **Memory is persistent**: Knowledge is retained across sessions
4. **Hooks automate workflow**: Reduce manual coordination overhead
5. **Topologies matter**: Choose based on task structure

## Common Misconceptions

❌ **Wrong**: Agents write code independently  
✅ **Right**: Agents coordinate Claude Code's actions

❌ **Wrong**: ruv-swarm executes commands  
✅ **Right**: ruv-swarm orchestrates, Claude Code executes

❌ **Wrong**: Each agent is a separate AI  
✅ **Right**: Agents are thinking patterns within the swarm
