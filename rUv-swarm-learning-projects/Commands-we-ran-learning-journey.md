- `README.md` - Documentation explaining concepts and usage
- `package.json` - Node.js project configuration

### First Run of Hello Swarm
```bash
node hello-swarm.js
```

#### Key Discoveries:
1. **Command Structure**: ruv-swarm uses different commands than expected:
   - `npx ruv-swarm init` (not `swarm init`)
   - `npx ruv-swarm status` (not `swarm status`)
   - `npx ruv-swarm hook <hook-name>` for hooks

2. **Available Commands**:
   - `init` - Initialize a new swarm
   - `claude` - Secure Claude Code integration
   - `mcp` - MCP server operations
   - `hook` - Execute integration hooks
   - `status` - Get swarm status

3. **Initialization Options**:
   - `--topology <type>` - mesh, hierarchical, star, ring
   - `--agents <number>` - Maximum number of agents
   - `--strategy <type>` - Distribution strategy (adaptive, balanced, etc.)

4. **Hooks Available**:
   - `pre-task` - Before starting work
   - `post-edit` - After file modifications
   - `notification` - For sharing updates
   - Session management hooks

5. **Architecture Understanding**:
   - ruv-swarm = Coordination layer (project manager)
   - Claude Code = Execution layer (development team)
   - Agents are cognitive patterns, not actual coders
   - MCP tools coordinate, Claude Code executes

### Persistence Error Note
The error "Cannot open database because the directory does not exist" is normal on first run. The persistence layer needs initialization.
