# ruv-swarm Learning Roadmap

## 📚 Your Hands-On Learning Journey

### ✅ Project 1: Hello Swarm (Completed)
**What you learned:**
- ruv-swarm architecture and philosophy
- Basic commands: init, status, hook
- Swarm topologies (mesh, hierarchical, star, ring)
- Hooks system for coordination
- Separation between coordination (ruv-swarm) and execution (Claude Code)

**Key files created:**
- `projects/01-hello-swarm/hello-swarm.js` - Basic demo
- `projects/01-hello-swarm/swarm-coordination-demo.js` - Coordination example
- `projects/01-hello-swarm/LEARNING-SUMMARY.md` - Concepts summary

---

### 🔄 Project 2: Task Coordinator (Next)
**What you'll learn:**
- Multi-agent task orchestration
- Using MCP tools in Claude Code
- Parallel task execution strategies
- Agent communication patterns
- Building a real coordination system

**Goals:**
- Create a task management system
- Coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks
- Implement memory-based task tracking
- Demonstrate parallel vs sequential execution

---

### 💾 Project 3: Memory-Based Chat Bot
**What you'll learn:**
- Persistent memory storage
- Context management across sessions
- Building conversational agents
- Memory retrieval strategies

---

### 🔍 Project 4: Code Analyzer
**What you'll learn:**
- Multi-agent code review
- Pattern recognition with agents
- Collaborative analysis workflows
- Performance optimization

---

### 🏗️ Project 5: API Builder
**What you'll learn:**
- Automated code generation coordination
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Real-world application patterns
- Integration with development tools

---

### 🧠 Project 6: Neural Learning System
**What you'll learn:**
- Advanced neural patterns
- Training and optimization
- Adaptive agent behaviors
- Performance benchmarking

---

### 🚀 Project 7: Real-world App
**What you'll learn:**
- Full-stack application coordination
- Production-ready patterns
- Complete workflow automation
- Best practices integration

---

## 🎯 Learning Approach

### For Each Project:
1. **Understand the concept** - Read documentation and examples
2. **Build hands-on** - Create working code
3. **Experiment** - Try variations and modifications
4. **Document** - Record what you learned
5. **Apply** - Use concepts in real scenarios

### Commands Reference Card
```bash
# Core Commands
npx ruv-swarm init --topology <type> --agents <n>
npx ruv-swarm status
npx ruv-swarm hook <name> --description "task"

# MCP Integration
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start

# Useful Variations
npx ruv-swarm init --topology mesh --agents 5
npx ruv-swarm init --topology hierarchical --agents 8
npx ruv-swarm init --topology star --agents 4
npx ruv-swarm init --topology ring --agents 6
```
