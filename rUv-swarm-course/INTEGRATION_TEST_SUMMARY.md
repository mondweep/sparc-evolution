## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES (Minor)**

### 🔗 **API Integration Issues**
1. **Mock Data vs Database:**
   - Courses API returns mock data instead of database content
   - Frontend displays courses correctly but from mock data source
   - **Impact:** Medium - Functionality works but not using live database

2. **Authentication Dependencies:**
   - Export endpoints temporarily have authentication disabled for testing
   - Code execution API has auth temporarily removed
   - **Impact:** Low - Testing purposes only, easily restored

### 🎯 **Frontend Display Issues**
1. **Swarm Lab & Explore Sections:**
   - Sections mentioned but content not fully populated
   - Navigation items present but limited content
   - **Impact:** Low - Infrastructure exists, content can be added
