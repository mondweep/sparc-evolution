# Debug Tests for rUv-Swarm Platform

## ‚úÖ Code Execution Status
Based on the logs, code execution appears to be **working correctly**:
- Backend logs show: `INFO - Executing javascript code` 
- Frontend logs show: `200 /api/code/execute`

The fix I applied earlier changed the response check from `response.data.success` to `response.data.status === 'success'` and this should have resolved the "Error: null" issue.

## üîç Navigation Debug Tests

I've added debug logging to the "Join Swarm" button. Please test this:

### Test 1: Check Join Swarm Button
1. Go to the Dashboard page
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) and go to Console tab
3. Click the "Join Swarm Lab" button
4. **Report what you see in the console** - it should show:
   ```
   Join Swarm Lab clicked - attempting navigation to /swarm-lab
   Navigation attempted successfully
   ```

### Test 2: Manual Navigation Test
In the browser console, run these commands one by one:
```javascript
// Test 1: Check current location
console.log('Current location:', window.location.pathname)

// Test 2: Test direct navigation
window.location.href = '/swarm-lab'
```

### Test 3: Code Execution Test
1. Go to the Code Editor page
2. Try running this simple JavaScript code:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello from rUv-Swarm!");
   return "Test successful";
   ```
3. **Report if you still see "Error: null" or if it works now**

## üéØ Expected Results

**Code Execution**: Should work now - no more "Error: null"
**Navigation**: Should work - console should show navigation messages
**SwarmLab**: Should load properly when navigated to

## üìã What to Report Back

Please run these tests and tell me:
1. **Console output** when you click "Join Swarm Lab" button
2. **What happens** when you try manual navigation to /swarm-lab
3. **Code execution result** - does it work now or still show "Error: null"?
4. **Any error messages** in browser console or network tab

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied
